      <h2 class="whale-title">Jellyfish</h2>
     <p>Jellyfish have drifted along on ocean currents for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth. The jellylike creatures pulse along on ocean currents and are abundant in cold and warm ocean water, in deep water, and along coastlines. But despite their name, jellyfish aren't actually fish—they're invertebrates, or animals with no backbones.Jellyfish have tiny stinging cells in their tentacles to stun or paralyze their prey before they eat them. Inside their bell-shaped body is an opening that is its mouth. They eat and discard waste from this opening.

        As jellyfish squirt water from their mouths they are propelled forward. Tentacles hang down from the smooth baglike body and sting their prey.
        
        Jellyfish stings can be painful to humans and sometimes very dangerous. But jellyfish don't purposely attack humans. Most stings occur when people accidentally touch a jellyfish, but if the sting is from a dangerous species, it can be deadly. Jellyfish digest their food very quickly. They wouldn't be able to float if they had to carry a large, undigested meal around.</p>
        <p>The life cycle of free-swimming scyphozoan jellyfish typically consists of three stages. A sessile polyp (scyphistoma) stage asexually buds off young medusae from its upper end, with each such ephyra growing into an adult. The adults are either male or female, but in some species they change their sex as they age. In many species, normal fusion of egg and sperm results in an embryo that is brooded in the gut of the adult until it becomes a ciliated planula larva, but in some this development takes place in the sea. After the planula larva leaves its parent, it lives for a time in the plankton and eventually attaches to a rock or other solid surface, where it grows into a new scyphistoma. Such a life cycle characterizes the order Semaeostomeae, which contains some 50 species of mainly coastal-water jellyfish, several of which have very wide geographic ranges. Included among these are members of the genera Aurelia and Chrysaora and the big red jellyfish, Tiburonia granrojo (subfamily Tiburoniinae), one of only three species of jellyfish that lack tentacles.</p>
        <p>Lacking brains, blood, or even hearts, jellyfish are pretty simple critters. They are composed of three layers: an outer layer, called the epidermis; a middle layer made of a thick, elastic, jelly-like substance called mesoglea; and an inner layer, called the gastrodermis. An elementary nervous system, or nerve net, allows jellyfish to smell, detect light, and respond to other stimuli. The simple digestive cavity of a jellyfish acts as both its stomach and intestine, with one opening for both the mouth and the anus.

            These simple invertebrates are members of the phylum Cnidaria, which includes creatures such as sea anemones, sea whips, and corals. Like all members of the phylum, the body parts of a jellyfish radiate from a central axis. This “radial symmetry” allows jellyfish to detect and respond to food or danger from any direction.
            
            Jellyfish have the ability to sting with their tentacles. While the severity of stings varies, in humans, most jellyfish stings result only in minor discomfort.</p>
            <p>

                This invertebrate is 98% water! This is what gives it its gelatinous appearance and makes it buoyant.
                
                Its umbrella-shaped body is therefore soft. To move, it closes its umbrella, which pushes the water away and moves it forward.
                
                The jellyfish is of great interest to the biotechnology sector! Jellyfish also contain 1% of a protein called collagen, similar to that found in humans. Collagen extracted from Rhizostoma pulmo jellyfish is being tested to produce artificial skin, particularly for burn victims, but also for cosmetic products.
                

All jellyfish are stinging and some are deadly, such as the Australian jellyfish Chironex fleckeri, nicknamed sea wasps.

This stinging characteristic also exists in relatives of jellyfish, such as coral and sea anemones. All are classified as cnidarians (from the Greek knidè, meaning nettle). There are more than 9,000 species of cnidarians, including 1,500 species of jellyfish.


The jellyfish may look fragile and delicate, but it has a secret weapon: its cnidocytes, which make it a fearsome predator. These stinging cells are found in their thousands along its filaments. On contact, they trigger a harpoon that injects venom.

A swimmer who cannot see its long filaments in the water may have a particularly searing memory of his or her encounter with a jellyfish.

On the beach, stranded jellyfish retain their striking power and remain venomous. So be careful - if you rub it, you sting yourself!

<p>

The jellyfish is a very ancient marine animal. Fossils dating back 600 million years have been discovered in Australia. Some of the footprints left correspond to the ancestors of jellyfish known as Ediacaria.

Jellyfish are all distinguished by their lack of heart, brain and lungs!

They breathe through the walls of their body. This does not prevent them from having a digestive system with a mouth between the tentacles, a stomach, muscles and nerves; and the manubrium, a tube at the end of which is the mouth, located between its tentacles.

Their nervous system is a simple network of cells: the edge of the umbrella carries balance organs, called rhopalies, and sensory organs that are sensitive to light.
