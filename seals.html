     <p>There are 33 species of pinnipeds alive today, most of which are known as seals. Pinnipedia is made up of three main groups: The walrus, which is the only living member of the family Odobenidae; the eared seals of Otariidae, including numerous kinds of fur seal and sea lion; and the earless seals, known as true seals or Phocidae. Despite the name, earless seals have ears—they’re just hidden beneath the surface of their skin.

        Pinnipeds can be found on every continent on Earth, though most species occur in cold-water environments. Thick layers of fat, also known as blubber, keep the animals warm, in addition to dense fur. Walruses are the exception to the rule, as these large, tusked pinnipeds have nearly hairless bodies.
        
        Seals range greatly in size, from the gargantuan southern elephant seal, which can weigh more than a pickup truck, to the relatively slender, 100-pound Baikal seal.
        
        While there are many differences among the species, all seals have feet shaped like fins. In fact, the word pinniped means "fin-footed" in Latin. Those fin-shaped feet make them supreme swimmers, and all pinnipeds are considered semi-aquatic marine mammals. This means they must spend some part of their lives on land or sea ice, usually during the mating and birthing seasons.
        
        With so much time spent in water, some species like the elephant seals have evolved the ability to hold their breath for up to two hours and dive to depths of more than 6,500 feet looking for food. (Read more about how diving animals can stay underwater for so long.)
        
        Nearly all seal species are reliant on marine habitats, though some will enter estuaries and rivers in search of food. An outlier is the Baikal seal, which spends its whole life in Lake Baikal, a freshwater lake in Siberia.
        
        Evolutionarily speaking, seals are thought to be most closely related to bears and the group of animals that includes weasels and otters, as well as skunks, raccoons, and red pandas.</p>
       <p>Seals live across the globe, though many prefer colder or polar waters. Some species have very specific ranges, such as the Hawaiian monk seal, which lives throughout the Hawaiian Islands, or the Galapagos fur seal, which lives around the Galapagos archipelago. There’s also the Caspian seal, which lives only in the Caspian Sea.

        These species tend to be the most vulnerable to endangerment because events in their specific areas can affect the entire population—compared to a widespread species like the crabeater seal, which lives throughout the entirety of the Antarctic and boasts a population of around 4,000,000.
        
        Because seals are semi-aquatic, they also live partially on land. Many species of seal will use coasts or sea ice to rest, thermoregulate, mate, and give birth. Some always remain close to the coast, like the walrus, because they prefer shallow waters and rest on land often.</p>
        <p>
            All seals eat other animals, and most rely on fish caught out at sea. But a few species break the mold.

For instance, leopard seals make a living hunting down penguins and even other seals. And walruses survive on a diet of clams and other shellfish, which they detect with their highly sensitive whiskers and then suction up from the seafloor with their powerful mouths.

There is also a species of pinniped known as the crabeater seal, which lives in Antarctica. However, these animals don’t eat crabs at all—at least not the kind you would think. Instead, these seals use highly specialized teeth to filter water for tiny, abundant crustaceans known as Antarctic krill.
        </p>
        <p>Various conservation groups and government organizations work to conserve pinnipeds through further research, education and management actions. Among government organizations working to protect these species is the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA fisheries works to protect harbor seals and other native seal species through targeted management actions. Some actions include reducing contaminants, minimizing human interactions and reducing vessel collisions and disturbance through educational materials. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) also works with agencies and coastal communities to ensure that harbor seals and other marine mammals are sustainably managed.</p>
